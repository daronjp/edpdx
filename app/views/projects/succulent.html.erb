      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <h3>Planning</h3>

      To start, you'll want to determine how tall you'd like your succulent planter to be.
      I chose 3 1/2 inches. Since a 4 x 4 beam is actually 3 1/2 x 3 1/2, this will create
      a perfect cube shape. The height of the planter will ultimately determine how much
      of the bottle gets cut off, so it's important to get this out of the way first. For
      this tutorial, I'll be making a 3 1/2 inch high display, but feel free to modify
      the size as you please.
      <br><br>
      Next, you'll need to consult the list of tools and supplies to determine what you
      need to complete the project. The majority of these items can be found at your local
      home improvement store, but a few will need to be purchased elsewhere. The Forstner
      bit is a speciality size, and can be found at a specialty woodworking store or on Amazon.
      The Kinkajou bottle cutter can be <a href='http://www.bottlecutting.com/'></a>purchased
      through the manufaturer's website, or at some craft stores.

      <p></p>

      <h3>Cutting the board</h3>

      Once you've determined the height of the display, it's time to cut that portion off
      your 4 x 4 beam. Take your tape measure and measure 3 1/2 inches up the beam and mark
      that location on the board. Next, use the triangle to draw a straight line across the
      board. Finally, take your miter saw and cut along the line you drew. Depending on the
      size of your blade you may need to rotate the board and make a second cut, or use
      a handsaw to cut off the remaining portion. I typically use a handsaw, as I find it
      makes a more accurate cut. After making the cut you should have a 3 1/2 inch cube.

      <p></p>

      <h3>Cutting the bottle</h3>

      <img alt="Beer Bottle" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/139/medium/IMG_0350.JPG?1458186601'>

      <br><br>

      Now that the wood is cut it's time to cut the bottle. For this, I used a taller style
      12 ounce beer bottle. This type should fit perfectly inside a 2 1/2 inch hole. I'd
      suggest drilling a hole into a scrap piece of wood to confirm before you start the
      next steps.
      <br><br>
      Before starting, you may want to begin boiling a kettle of water so that it is ready
      for you once the cut has been completed. You'll also want to get a container of ice
      water ready as well.
      <br><br>
      To cut your bottle, insert it into the Kinkajou bottle cutter so that the cutting
      blade lines up with your desired bottle height. It should be at least an inch and
      a half tall, but no taller than one inch less than the height of your board. I
      cut the bottle so that it is two inches tall.
      <br><br>
      Once the bottle is oriented in the Kinkajou a the appropriate depth, secure it in
      place with the outside levers. You should be able to rotate the bottle fairly easily.
      Next, engage the cutter and make a full rotation of the bottle. I found that it
      took some practice to consistently rotate the bottle so that it creates a perfectly
      horizontal line.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="Kinkajou bottle cutter" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/147/large/IMG_0353.JPG?1459040968'>

      <br><br>
      Once the glass has been scored, take the included rubber dividers and place one on
      either end of the score line.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="Kinkajou tutorial" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/148/large/IMG_0354.JPG?1459040985'>
      <br><br>
      For safety, be sure to wear gloves and safety goggles to prevent injury.
      <br><br>
      Over the sink, slowly pour the boiling water between the two rubber dividers
      and onto the the score line to heat the glass. Next, slowly pour the ice water
      onto the score line to quickly cool the glass. Then, switch back to boiling water
      and continue alternating between the two temperatures until the glass breaks.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="Kinkajou cut bottle" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/150/large/IMG_0358.JPG?1459041036'>
      <br><br>
      Ideally you'll end up with a perfectly clean cut, but sometimes there may be a
      jagged portion that remains. You can use the included tool to carefully pry the
      remaining piece off so that you are left with a perfectly flat cut. Be careful
      though! What remains is razor sharp glass that can easily cut your skin and cause
      injuries.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="Kinkajou fix bottle" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/151/large/IMG_0359.JPG?1459041053'>
      <br><br>
      The next step is to smooth the sharp glass. Be sure to wear gloves during this step
      to help prevent cuts. To speed up the process a bit, I place
      the cut edge directly on top of a belt sander with 40 grit sandpaper.

      <br><br>
      <img alt="Sand cut bottle" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/158/large/IMG_0361.JPG?1459225155'>
      <br><br>

      Once the edge is frosted over, move on to sanding with finer grits by hand. I use 60, 100, 150, 220,
      400, and 800 grit. Take your time and be certain that all sharp areas are smooth. Once complete,
      you should have a perfectly smooth lip on your bottle.

      <br><br>

      <img alt="smoothed cut bottle" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/161/large/IMG_0367.JPG?1459225238'>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Drilling the hole</h3>

      Once the wood has been cut, it's time to drill the hole that the bottle will sit inside.
      Take your triangle and draw a straight line between each opposing corner so that an 'X'
      is created on the top of the cube where the hole will be cut into. I chose to drill into
      the end grain (the side of the wood cut in the previous step).

      <br><br>

      <img alt="forstner drill setup" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/152/large/IMG_0371.JPG?1459041480'>

      <br><br>

      Next, hold the cut bottle flush with the top of the cube and mark where the bottom of
      the bottle sits.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="drill measurement" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/156/large/IMG_0372.JPG?1459126490'>
      <br><br>
      Then, insert the 2 1/2 inch into the drill press. Once the bit
      is securly fastened, lower the bit alongside the cube and set the depth stop on
      the drill press so that the bottom of the drill bit aligns with the mark you made.
      This will ensure that the top of the bottle sits flush with the top of the cube.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="drill press depth stop" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/157/large/IMG_0374.JPG?1459126514'>
      <br><br>
      Slowly lower the drill bit and align the cube so that where the two lines you drew
      intersect with the point of the drill bit. Turn on the drill press and begin
      boring out the hole. Continue drilling until you hit the depth stop.

      <br><br>
      <img alt="forstner bit drill action" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/162/large/IMG_0378.JPG?1459225848'

      <br><br>

      If measured correctly, the bottle should easily fit into the hole and the top of the
      bottle will be flush with the top of the cube. If some of the bottle is extending
      out of the hole, adjust the depth stop on the drill press and redrill.
      <br><br>
      <img alt="bottle check" src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/163/large/IMG_0377.JPG?1459225876'>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Rounding the edges</h3>

      The next step if you prefer is to round the edges. This certainly isn't required, but
      I think it gives the display a nice, consistent look. Take a 1/2 inch roundover bit and
      insert it into your router. Secure the bit, and attach your router to the router table.
      Adjust the depth so that the bottom portion of the roundover bit is not touching the
      wood.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/164/large/IMG_0379.JPG?1459383237'>
      <br><br>

      Next, turn on the router and run each side through the bit. The bearing on the top of the
      roundover bit will allow for a consistent cut each time. Be sure that the bearing only runs
      along the faces of the wood that were not drilled. The bearing is likely high enough that it
      will fall into the hole can cause a large and unsightly divot in your otherwise clean edge.
      Due to the way the grain is set,
      you'll likely end up with some fairly rough corners on the top and bottom portions of the
      cube. That's alright though, as we'll clean that up in the next step.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/165/large/IMG_0380.JPG?1459383254'>
      <br><br>

      Once the edges have been rounded, we're left with the rough shape of the succulent holder.
      The next step will be to clean up the rough areas of the wood so that it is nice and smooth.
      Start by inserting 60-grit sandpaper into your sheet sander. The sides of the wood should be
      fairly smooth already, so you may only need to sand the rounded edges as well as the end
      grain on the top and bottom. I like to sand in a circular motion so that the sanding is
      consistent throughout.

      <br><br>

      Next, replace your rough 60-grit sandpaper with finer 100-grit paper. In addition to sanding
      the rounded edges as well as the end grain, you'll want to sand the sides as well. Repeat
      this process with 150 and 220-grit sandpaper. When this is finished you should be left
      with a very smooth piece of wood.

      <br><br>
      <h3>Finishing the wood</h3>

      In order to maximize the smoothness of your succulent holder, as well as ensure that the
      stain absorbes as evenly as possible into the wood, you'll want to apply a coat of Minwax
      pre-stain wood conditioner. The conditioner helps to raise the grain and prepares the
      wood for staining. Apply the conditioner using a foam brush, and let it penetrate the wood
      for 1-5 minutes. Then, be sure to take a rag and wipe off any excess wood conditioner.
      Let the wood sit until dry. As the wood dries, you should notice that it is no longer rough.
      This is due to the grain raising that takes place during the wood conditioning process. To
      resmooth the wood, resand with 220-grit sandpaper.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/166/large/IMG_0387.JPG?1461457697'>
      <br><br>

      Now you're prepared to stain the wood. Take a foam brush and evenly apply Minxax wood stain to
      each face of the succulent holder. I found it easiest to place a few fingers in the
      drilled out hole so that I don't get stain all over my hands. After applying the stain,
      wait between 5-15 minutes before wiping off the exess stain. It's important not to allow
      any excess stain to dry to on the outside of the wood. As you are wiping off the stain,
      try to blend light and dark areas to get uniform coverage. If the initial coat isn't quite
      as dark as you were hoping, apply a second coat 4-6 hours after the initial coat.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/167/large/IMG_0389.JPG?1461458312'>
      <br><br>

      When the wood has been stained the color you want, the last step in finishing the wood is
      to apply a few coats of protective Minwax Polycrylic. Stir the contents of the can, and
      apply a thin coat in the direction of the wood grain using a synthetic bristle brush.
      Allow the Polycrylic to dry for at least two hours. Upon drying, the surface will be
      slightly rough. Take 220-grit sandpaper and lightly sand off the rough portions making
      sure not to oversand and remove any of the underlying stain. After sanding, wipe off
      (I prefer to vaccuum) any dust that you've created and then apply another layer of
      Polycrylic. You'll want to apply at least 2-3 coats.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/168/large/IMG_0393.JPG?1461458973'>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Adding the succulents</h3>

      The very last step, of course, is to plant succulents inside the cut bottle. Start
      by adding some well draining soil into the bottle. For mine, I used a home made mixture
      of dirt and sand, though you can find specialized soil at your local nursery. Next, you'll
      want to find succulents to plant! We have a variety of succulents growing in our yard,
      so I took a few different varieties and planted them in the bottle. Of course, most
      nurseries also sell succulents.

      <br><br>
      <img src='https://edpdxprod.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/avatars/000/000/169/large/IMG_0401.JPG?1461459519'>
      <br><br>


      Once your succulents have been planted, insert the
      bottle into the drilled hole in the wood and you're all finished!
